TASK:
Imagine that you have a certain number of stones
n (3 ≤ n ≤ 100) of known weight w1, w2, w3, ...,
where wi are positive integers from 1 to 1000000 inclusive.
Write a script that will distribute the stones into two heaps so
that the difference in the weights of these two heaps is minimal.
The number of stones and weights should be generated randomly.
The script itself should return a number equal to the minimum
weight difference of the two heaps.
